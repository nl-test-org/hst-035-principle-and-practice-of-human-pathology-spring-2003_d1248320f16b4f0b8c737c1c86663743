Lodish H., et al. _Molecular Cell Biology._ 4th ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., 1999. ISBN: 9780716731368, is recommended for those interested in learning more about cellular biology. A limited [online version](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=mcb.TOC) of this book is available through the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health.

[WebPath](http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/webpath.html) is a great resource for "flipping through" numerous jpeg images of normal and abnormal human tissues and organs.

For those with access to Internet Explorer, a nice [Virtual Slidebox](http://www.path.uiowa.edu/virtualslidebox/) of histology and pathology is available from the University of Iowa Department of Pathology.

If you need to look up a medical word, you can search for it online in the [MedTerms Medical Dictionary](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/alphaidx.asp?p=a_dict) via MedicineNet.
